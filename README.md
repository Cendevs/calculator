The calculator app contains functions for all of the basic math operators typically find on simple as follows;
**add**,
**subtract**,
**multiply**,
**divide**,

Users are able to string together several operations and get the right answer, with each pair of numbers being evaluated at a time. For example, 12 + 7 - 5 * 3 = yields 42.  Note that calculator does not evaluate more than a single pair of numbers at a time. If a number is entered, then an operator and another number that calculation is displayed if your next input is an operator. The result of the calculation is used as the first number in a new calculation operation.

**Answers* are rounded up to 7 d.p.

**AC* (clear) button feature so user can clear the calculator memory to start a fresh operation.

**Zero* division error checked.

**Users* can get floating point numbers if they do the math required to get one, and have ability to type in decimal numbers.

**Backspace** button, so the user can undo if they click the wrong number.
